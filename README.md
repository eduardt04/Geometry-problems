% 2_segement_intersection : Given 4 points A1, A2, A3, A4 find whether the segments [A1, A3] and [A2, A4] intersect, and if they do print their intesection.\
% convex_hull: Given a polygon, find its convex hull. ( Graham Scan method, O(n*logn) time complexity )\
% point_position: Given 4 points, find if the polygon A1A2A3A4 is convex, and if it is find the position of A4 relative to the circumscribed circle of the triangle A1A2A3.\
% triangulation: Given a polygon, find a triangulation ( Ear clipping method, O(nˆ2) ). Given a point, print its position relative to the polygon ( inside, on the edges, outside ), and if it is inside, print in which triangle it is situated.
